My Screen name in Xsplit is Stormbear Hope u choose me 
If you want to know why i need this Xsplit copy i got some Answers xD

Hello Swifty , I'm Vasilen Lubomirov 16 years old and im from Bulgaria(its in Europe).
i want this copy of Xsplit cuz i saw how easy is to make videos with it cuz i tried 

Xsplit(free) before that i tried to make videos with sony vegas + fraps but actually there is not so much 

space on my hard drive to store the vids that i want to include and when i put the video that i recorded with 
fraps it takes forever to load xD nd its alot harder to make the things look as the way u want . 
i want this copy of Xsplit to save some money for my channel cuz as you know its not cheap to buy all the tech 
you need :camera , microphone, enought good internet + pc. So one good start for me will be this copy of Xsplit 
then i will need only to buy myself pc camera to start releaseing  some kind of videos til i save 

enought money to buy the other stuff.Now for the channel that i want to start 

I'm gamer like most of the people here and my dream is to become famous youtuber 
like you and alot of other ppl that find place in this amazing site.
I started watching your videos a month ago cuz Siv Hd stoped to release anything and i found your tips of 

creating youtube channel much better than his.
Im not WoW player i like the idea of the game but im not good at it( because of this macros 1000 things to pop your 
Cd's and this Tab targeting + when i was owned with my warlock at the public beta on cata early patches by 
wars that two shot me in the arena when they pop all the cds because im not so skilled nd i find this thing to 
dot my target and run because to start doing something i must w8 some time because dots are prediodic dmg) so i 
dont play wow . I play games 
like dota 2 and league of legends because for me is more easy to remember 100+ heroes with 4 spells than 10 

classes with 30+ spells . 
So im Dota type player , and i want to make succesful channel i got some funny footage playing mostly lol 

(cuz i got my Dota 2 invite last month)with my friends and how we lose because of ppl that are bad in this 

current game ,its not big deal but if every one knows little basics in this type of game it would be better 

place to rest from your everyday life  .

In lol and Dota 2 if u play solo que you are doomed xD.i want to change that . I want to give strategies to 
ppl not some pro 
strategies cuz im not EPIC PRo i just want to give some usefull strategies to ppl to know 

atleast some basics like That if u go nd play ranked u must be rdy to play every role in the game(lol) and 

how to dont sabotage their teammates because of their fail(not because u may be bad player sometimes luck 

is involved but everyone have games like theese ). In the most games when u fail you start to sabotage ur 

teammates that are actually trying to change the score. This happens because you always blame others for your 
fail (its junglers fault no 

ganks ,im epic pro, enemy team is lucky and no matter that you feed them enought you start to Ks important 

kills for your teammates)

THIS IS RLY BAD  

1 death award 300g
2 death award 273 g 
...............
...............
...............
6 death award 135g ( not alot of gold you wont be focused so much because you dont cost the risk to be 

chased) 
Then if you take kill you cost again 300g then u continue to feed them because u are out feed  nd they will 

burst you for a few moments)
So if you feed (try to focus yourself of being as much usefull to your teammates lategame and focus on 

defending and creeping and assisting your team)
Actually this will help to the players in Elo Hell in league of legends and it will make it more comfortable 

for every body like in highter elo.

This is not only one thing that i want to do in my channel. Actually to be gamer is my second hobby.
My 1st hobby is to make hard workouts in the gym nd i want to give some advices to ppl how to change their 

body cuz most of the gamers are not comfortable with their body. 
Before 4 years  when i was in 7 grade i was 98 kilograms( i got heavy bone and i was not looking so bad but 

actually i was not comfortable with my body ) so i started to go to the local gym 4 times a week.
Now im 88 kilograms but im more athletic and actually my power rised almost 4  times in the begining i was 

lifting 30kg from bench 4 series 10 iterations now i lift 110kg  5 - 7 iterations without sweat xD. 

Actually i will talk for the life at all.Why its important to study , why its important to be good person , 
why is important to have good demeanor with other
ppl , how to even start dating girls and maybe even to find one perfect girl for you that is natural 
and is not some kind of simplistic cover.




Actually i want to make good channel to change my life a bit because i think its a great start for someone 
who wants to find himself and his way to the top.


P.s.  I tried chromakey effect in Xsplit it looks rly badass if you wear shirt with the same color that 

is ignored from Xsplit. Because when i was wathing your question vids with this effects i was like "i must 
buy t-shirt like that" then i understood that this is chromakey effect and i was like in Minecraft when you 
find a whole new horizont to explore in the early sunrise xD  Sry for my bad english its not my native but i 
actually will start taking some exercises to make him better.
